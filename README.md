# Decision Tree Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects focusing on Decision Tree classification. Below is an overview of each project:

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
### Project Purpose:
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features such as passenger class, age, sex, and fare using a Decision Tree classifier.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the Titanic dataset and clean it by removing irrelevant columns and mapping categorical data to numerical formats.
- **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and test sets for model evaluation.
- **Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree classifier and evaluate its accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the decision tree structure to understand decision-making.

## 2. Iris Flower Classification
### Project Purpose:
Classify Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using a Decision Tree based on sepal and petal measurements.

### Key Steps:
- **Dataset Loading**: Load the Iris dataset using `scikit-learn` and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Preparation**: Map target values to class labels for better interpretation.
- **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and test sets.
- **Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree with controlled depth to prevent overfitting.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the tree structure to show how decisions are made.

## 3. Breast Cancer Detection
### Project Purpose:
Use a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a breast cancer sample is malignant or benign based on medical measurements.

### Key Steps:
- **Dataset Loading**: Load the Breast Cancer dataset from `scikit-learn`.
- **Data Splitting**: Divide the data into training and test sets.
- **Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree classifier using the `entropy` criterion.
- **Model Evaluation**: Check the accuracy on training and test data.
- **Visualization**: Plot the tree structure for interpretation of the decision process.

## 4. Diabetes Prediction
### Project Purpose:
Train a Decision Tree model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a patient based on health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and handle missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and check dataset balance.
- **Feature Selection**: Choose specific health metrics as features for the model.
- **Model Training**: Train the Decision Tree with different parameters for optimal accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the trained Decision Tree to illustrate decision splits.
